## 📌 About the Project

**Meet Up** is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The project mimics React-style routing using `window.location.hash` without any frameworks. It showcases a dynamic event list with custom dropdown filtering, navigation between views, and modular architecture.

The project follows the **BEM methodology** and a **component-based structure**. All data is loaded from separate JS files, simulating remote data fetching and demonstrating modular separation of logic and data.

## 🔥 Features

- 📄 **Single Page Application (SPA)** – implemented using hash-based routing with vanilla JS.
- 🧭 **Page Navigation** – switches between views without page reload using `window.location.hash`.
- 🎴 **Event Card Filtering** – sort and filter by type, distance, and category.
- 📥 **External Data Files** – simulates working with remote data sources.
- ⬇️ **Custom Dropdown Lists** – built completely from scratch without libraries.
- 🎨 **BEM + Component-Based Structure** – clean, modular, and scalable code.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – supports screen sizes: 390px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px and up.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – markup and component structure  
- **SCSS** – styling, variables, nesting, responsive breakpoints  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – routing logic, rendering, filtering  
- **window.location.hash** – for client-side routing  
- **BEM + Component Architecture** – for maintainability and readability
